Direct Sharing
- Simplest form of data sharing
- Shares are setup by the provider account and they must specify which consumers can access this data
- It is possible to share with other Snowflake accounts as well as non-Snowflake customers





Data Exchange
- Private Data Sharing Hub
- Similar to Marketplace
- Snowflake account owning the data exchange can enable sharing of data with
  - Partners
  - Suppliers
  - Vendors
  - Customers




Snowflake Performance Factors
- Caching
  - Metadata Cache
  - Query Result Cache
  - Virtual Warehouse Cache aka Local Disk Cache
- Scaling Up
- Scaling Down
- Scaling Out: multi-cluster virtual warehouse
- Improved partition pruning via clustering keys
- Materialized views
- Search optimization



Query Profile
- Provides a graphical representation of a query's execution
- Provides execution details for a query
- Statistics and details for each step
- Statistics and details for the whole query




Query Result Cache
- When a query is executed, Snowflake caches the query results for a period
- Snowflake uses the Query Result Cache to avoid re-executing queries when there are no changes to data
- Query Result Cache is used by a new query if
  - The query syntactically matches the previously executed query
  - The data in underlying table hasn't changed, and the micro-partitions haven't changed
  - The query doesn't use functions that are evaluated at runtime, or UDF or external functions
  - The security role running the query has the required privileges
