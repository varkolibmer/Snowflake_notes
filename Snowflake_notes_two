External Tables
- External tables allow you to create tables on data stored external to Snowflake
  - Definition in Snowflake metadata
  - Data in external location
- External table functionality lets you query an external table like a regular table
  - Join with other tables
  - Create views on top of external tables
- External tables are read-only since they point to external storage
  - DML operations cannot be performed on them
- External table data does not contribute to Snowflake storage costs
  - The compute cost is charged when queries are executed







Unload Data from Snowflake
- Encryption
  - Automatically encrypted when exporting to an internal stage
  - Not automatically encrypted when exported to an external stage
    - Although can be configured to encrypt by providing an encryption key
- Single vs. Multiple files
  - Exported to multiple files by default
  - Can be charged to a single file






Time Travel
- Time Travel
  - Travel back to a point in time
  - Travel back to a point before a query
  - Undrop objects
  - Undo accidental changes
- Which objects
  - Databases
  - Schemas
  - Tables
- Some use cases
  - Query data in past
  - Restore dropped databases, tables, and schemas
  - Combine time travel with cloning






Fail-safe Storage
- Provides a 7-day period during which historical data is recoverable by Snowflake
- Period starts immediately after the time travel period ends
- Fail safe data can only be recovered by the Snowflake support
- Provides a way to recover lost data in a relatively quick manner
- Snowflake's redundant and cheap data storage architecture reduces the need for backups, there still can be scenarios for data loss
- Failsafe storage provides a safety cushion in such scenarios and allows you to recover data 7 days after even your time travel history is gone





Types of tables in Snowflake
- Temporary
  - Exist-only for the lifetime of a session
  - They are not visible to other sessions and are removed immediately once the session ends
- Transient
  - Similar to temporary tables, but they persist between sessions. They are designed to hold temporary data that needs to be accessed across sessions
    - Ex: ETL jobs
- Permanent
  - This is the default type of table in Snowflake, if you don't specify the type, a table is created as Permanent





Cloning in Snowflake
- ZERO Copy Cloning
  - Metadata Operation
  - Perform by Cloud Services Layer using micro-partition metadata
  - No physical data movement
  - No extra storage requirement
  - Generally a very fast operation
- CLONE command
  - Supported objects:
    - Databases, Schemas, and Tables
    - Streams
    - Stages, File formats, Sequences, Tasks






Secure Data Sharing
- Metadata Operation
- Perform by Cloud Services Layer using micro-partition metadata
- No physical data movement
- Generally a very fast operation
