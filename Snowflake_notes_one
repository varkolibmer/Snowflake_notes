Snowflake: Traditional Database Architecture
- Shared-disk:
  - SMP
  - Storage is shared
  - Multiple CPU but shared
- Shared-nothing:
  - MPP
  - Storage and compute are Decentralized
  - Each node has its Allocated Storage
  - Massively Parallel Processing






Snowflake Hybrid Architecture
- Multi-Cluster, Shared Data:
  - Separation of storage and compute allows unlimited scalability which is independent of each other






Cloud Services Layer
- Metadata and Management
- Security and Governance
- Sharing
- Query Parsing
- Query optimization
- ACID control







Snowflake Cost
- Snowflake Cost
  - AWS S3
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - Based on actual storage
  - Columnar compression and other techniques save cost
- Compute Cost
  - Loading data
  - Processing data
  - Only for actual usage
  - Virtual warehouses can help minimize costs
- Serverless Compute Costs
  - Snowpipe
  - Automatic clustering
  - Database replication
  - Materialized view
  - Search optimization
- Data Transfer
  - No cost for transfer in
  - Costs on transfer out to other regions and to other cloud platforms
- Cloud services
  - Up to 10% of cloud services is free
  - Database definitions
  - Table definitions
  - Users etc.






Table Stage
- Table stage cannot be created or dropped. They are automatically created and available for a table's lifetime
- They share the table's name and can be referenced using @%tablename syntax
- They don't support file format options. The COPY command must include these arguments
- They don't allow data transformations while loading the data







User stage
- Can't be created or dropped. They are automatically created and available for a user lifetime
- They can be referenced using @~ syntax
- They don't support file format options. The COPY command must include these arguments






Basic Data Transformations
- Basic transformations allowed during ingestion using COPY
  - Omit column(s)
  - Change order of the columns
  - Cast columns into specific data types 
  - Truncate
- Transformations not supported during COPY
  - Joins
  - Filters i.e. WHERE clause
  - Aggregation functions
